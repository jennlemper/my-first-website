You always begin with <!doctypehtml> to tell the browser it's an html document
  Then you put <html> and </html> at the end
<body> --> what you want on your page
<head> --> doesn't show on your page itself --> exp. Titel

  <h1> biggest font available </h1> --> <h6> is the smallest heading </h6>
  <p> paragraph </p>
  <b> bold </b>
  <em> italic </em>
  <div> different sections </div>
  <ol> = numbered list </ol>
  <ul> = bullet points </ul>
  <a> = a link </a>


  Week 2
  css/styles.css --> it says what kind of document it is
  rgb --> mix of red green and blue (values 0 to 255)
    (255, 0, 0) = red
    (0, 255, 0) = green
    (0, 0, 255) = blue
    body{
      color:rgb(255, 0, 0);
    }
        --> selector{property:value;}
margin:0px = closets to the webpage (border)

  vh = vitual height --> top and bottom
  vw = vitual width --> left and right

  5em = relative to the font size of the element

  flex --> display different components of the page --> flexible placing

  margin: 0 auto; --> puts it in the middle
    the picture will automatically work with our flex --> so it will be in the middle

  padding: so it won't overlap anything
  border-radius: it makes it round
  40% =  40% of your page (width)

  list-style: none; --> takes of the numbers

  justify-content: space-evenly; --> this always goes with display flex.
  So that the space between the list will be evenly.

  <id> you give and id to something; you can only use it once; it is unique </id>
  you use a # for it; for example h2#substitle --> and then you can change that color

  <class> can be used mutiple times in a html page </class>
  it works within the divs
